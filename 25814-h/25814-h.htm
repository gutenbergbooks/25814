<h3>
HISTORICAL NOTE
</h3>
<p>
While the popular conception of Lincoln as the Liberator of the Slave is true historically, there is a deeper view of his life and character. He was the savior, if not the real creator, of the American Union of free Democratic States. His proclamation of emancipation was purely an incident of war. The first policy of his administration was to save the Union. To this fact we owe a united Nation to-day. It is this truth of history which I try to make a living reality in my play.
</p>
<p>
The scenes relating to the issues of our National life have been drawn from authentic records. The plot of the action is based on the letter of Colonel John Nicolay to Major Hay, dated August 25, 1864, in which the following opening paragraph is found:
</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p>
&#34;Hell is to pay. The New York politicians have got a stampede on that is about to swamp everything. Raymond and the National Committee are here to-day. R. thinks a Commission to Richmond is about the only salt to save us; while the President sees and says it would be utter ruination. The matter is now undergoing consultation. Weak-kneed damned fools are in the movement for a new candidate to supplant the President. Everything is darkness, doubt, and discouragement.&#34;
</p>
</div>
<p>
No liberty has been taken with an essential detail of history in the development of the action except to slightly shift the dates of two incidents for dramatic unity. In neither case does the change of date affect the validity of the scene as used.

</p>
<p class="outdent">
<span class="sc">
Set Scene</span>:
<i>
The rough-hewn log cabin of Tom Lincoln is seen in the center surrounded by the forest wilderness of Southern Indiana, 1820.
</i>
</p>
<p class="outdent">
<i>
The cabin door is cut in level with the ground. There is no shutter to the door and no window to the cabin.
</i>
</p>
<p class="outdent">
<i>
Right and Left of the door opening are rude benches of split logs. On the walls are stretched a coon and a small bear, squirrel and muskrat skins. In the foreground on the right is seen an old-fashioned wash pot set on three stones. Near the wash pot is fixed in the ground a pole, on the top of which are hung six gourds cut for martin swallows to nest in. Beside it are a rude bench and two wash tubs. On the left is a crude settee made of a split log with legs set in augur holes and a rough back made of saplings. An old-fashioned doctor's saddle-bags hang across the back of the settee. The trees are walnut, beech and oak&#8212;undergrowth of dogwood, sumac and wild grapevines. These vines, festooned over the cabin, give a sinister impression. A creek winds down through the hills behind the cabin.

<p class="outdent">
<span class="sc">

<span class="sc">
Sarah

You had grown a man&#8212;strong and brave&#8212;wise and gentle. The people hung on your words, and did you homage. But you remembered this cabin here in the deep woods and you were humble. I walked with you between two white pillars. It was still and solemn, in there. Outside I could hear the people calling your name. You bowed low and whispered in my ear: &#34;This is all yours, my Mother. I bought it for you with my life. All that I am I owe to you&#8212;&#8212;&#34;

Colonel Nicolay, the President's Secretary, is seen writing before an enormous pile of mail. He reads a letter and throws it down in disgust. Reads another and hurls it into the waste basket.

Stanton, I appointed you Secretary of War against the advice of every man about me. You were a cantankerous Democrat and my enemy. You had said the meanest things about me that were ever spoken in Washington&#8212;and that's putting it pretty strong. You called me a low clown&#8212;the original gorilla. In spite of all this, I saw
<i>
your
</i>
great qualities! I saw that you were absolutely fearless and absolutely honest, that your nerves were made of steel and your capacity for work was boundless. Even in your passions and hatreds, you showed a loyalty to the Union that rose above the parties and creeds of a lifetime. I like men of your strong personality. They stand between a nation and hell. And so, I appointed you, my bitter foe, to my cabinet. I've never regretted it for a minute in these years of blood and anguish. You've made the best Secretary of War this country ever had. In spite of your mean traits and your awful profanity, I've learned to love you! Now, you've resigned, and done your duty, as you see it. I've accepted your resignation,

conscripted

you again, and reappointed you&#8212;&#8212;!

Your race is suffering, in my judgment, the greatest wrong inflicted on any people. But even when you cease to be slaves, you are yet far removed from being placed on an equality with the white race.

I've come to you, Mr. President, under an impulse I could not resist. Mr. Stoddard, your third Secretary, is my friend. He told me this morning that all night the sound of your footfall came from this room. He heard it at nine, at ten, at eleven. At midnight the Secretary of War left the door ajar and the steady tramp came with heavier sound. The last thing he heard at three was the muffled beat upstairs. The guard said it had not stopped at daylight. I saw you staggering alone under a Nation's sorrow and I wondered if you had been given the vision to see the dawn of a new life for our people. I know I'm looking into the eyes of the man whose word can stop this war and divide the Union&#8212;I have come to tell you that I lost my first born son at Fredericksburg&#8212;a lad of twenty&#8212;&#8212;

office pouring hot shot into the flanks of our enemies, and the boys were all at home fighting for the victory that must be ours on the first Tuesday in November. Not that you're unwelcome. You are the leaders of public opinion. The people rule this country, and I am their servant&#8212;what is it&#8212;&#8212;?
</p>
<p class="speaker">
Raymond
</p>
<p>
You may be sure, Mr. President, that our mission is of the gravest importance. These gentlemen have brought such startling reports from their several states as to the bitterness and closeness of the fight, that they have reached a unanimous conclusion&#8212;&#8212;
</p>
<p class="speaker">
Lincoln
</p>
<p>
And that is&#8212;&#8212;?
</p>
<p class="speaker">
Raymond
</p>
<p>
That with your personality and record against General McClellan's, your Democratic opponent&#8212;the election for us is lost.
</p>
<p class="speaker">
Lincoln
</p>
<p>
Your statement is blunt. But, as I have been renominated for a second term, my administration has been endorsed by our party, and the election is only eight weeks off&#8212;there is but one conclusion possible&#8212;and that is, that you should roll up your sleeves and get to work.

<p class="speaker">

<p>
The Committee made their request solely on the ground of patriotic duty&#8212;and ask you for the sacrifice upon the same grounds. They have found it impossible to defend your policies&#8212;&#8212;
</p>
<p class="speaker">
Lincoln
</p>
<p class="direction">
[<i>Brusquely.</i>]
</p>
<p>
What policies?
</p>
<p class="speaker">
Raymond
</p>
<p>
Understand me, Mr. President&#8212;I am telling you the conclusion of this Committee&#8212;&#8212;
</p>
<p class="speaker">
Lincoln
</p>
<p>
All right, Raymond&#8212;fire away&#8212;spare me the oratory, please&#8212;just give me the plain reasons, one at a time, why you wish me to get off the ticket&#8212;&#8212;
</p>
<p class="speaker">
Raymond
</p>
<p>
The first policy found indefensible has been your handling of the border slave states of Maryland, Kentucky and Missouri. You have not yet declared the slaves free in these states, the only ones in which you actually have the power to do so&#8212;at all.
</p>
<p class="speaker">
Lincoln
</p>
<p>
The first policy of my Administration has been to save for the Union the great border states&#8212;for the simple reason&#8212;with these border slave states, we have such a balance of power that the Union
<i>
may
</i>
be saved! Without these states, the Union
<i>
cannot
</i>
be saved! Therefore in my Proclamation of Emancipation, I purposely did not raise the question of the right or wrong of slavery. If slavery is not wrong, nothing is wrong. But the Constitution of the United States, which I have sworn to uphold in the border states of Maryland, Kentucky and Missouri, guarantees to their people the right to hold slaves if they choose.
</p>
<p class="speaker">
Raymond
</p>
<p>
But why pat on the back the slaveholder of Maryland and strike at the slaveholder of South Carolina?
</p>
<p class="speaker">
Lincoln
</p>
<p>
Because Maryland is loyal to the Union, and South Carolina is fighting it. My Proclamation was not a sermon on the rights of man&#8212;black or white. It was an act of war&#8212;a blow aimed at the heart of the seceding South to break its wealth and power, end the war, and save the Union. I know the spell of
<i>
State loyalty
</i>
in the South, gentlemen. I was born there. Many a mother in Richmond wept the day our flag fell from their Capitol. But they brushed their tears away and sent their sons to the front the next day, to fight that flag&#8212;<i>in the name of Virginia</i>! So would thousands of mothers in these border slave states, if I put them to the test. In God's own time slavery will be destroyed. I have saved these states for our cause by conciliation and compromise. I will not apologize for this act.
</p>
<p class="direction">
[<i>He lifts his hand to stop interruption.</i>]
</p>
<p>
My paramount object is to save the Union, and not, either to save or destroy slavery. If I could save the Union, without freeing a slave, I would do it. And if I could save it by freeing all the slaves, I would do it. And if I could save it by freeing some and leaving others alone, I would also do that. What I do about slavery and the colored race, I do because I believe it
<i>
helps to save this Union</i>!
</p>
<p class="direction">
[<i>Pauses and faces his accusers.</i>]
</p>
<p>
I'll test this question right here&#8212;will the three Committeemen from Kentucky, Missouri and Maryland stand up for a minute?
</p>
<p class="direction">
[<i>The three Committeemen rise.</i>]
</p>
<p>
Will the gentleman from Kentucky tell me what would have been the effect if I had included his state in my proclamation freeing the slaves&#8212;&#8212;?
</p>
<p class="speaker">
The Kentucky Committeeman
</p>
<p>
The state would have seceded from the Union, sir.
</p>
<p class="speaker">
Lincoln
</p>
<p>
Just so, and in Missouri?
</p>
<p class="speaker">
The Missouri Committeeman
</p>
<p>
The Legislature would have joined the Confederacy within twenty-four hours.
</p>
<p class="speaker">
Lincoln
</p>
<p>
And Maryland&#8212;&#8212;?
</p>
<p class="speaker">
The Maryland Committeeman
</p>
<p>
Maryland would have promptly cut the railroads leading into Washington, isolated the Capital and joined the South.
</p>
<p class="speaker">
Lincoln
</p>
<p>
And with the loss of our Capital, Europe, eager to strike, would have recognized the Confederacy, would they not?
</p>
<p class="speaker">
The Maryland Committeeman
</p>
<p>
Undoubtedly, sir&#8212;&#8212;
</p>
<p class="speaker">

</p>
<p class="speaker">

Our State believed you when you said in your Inaugural: &#34;I have no purpose directly or indirectly to interfere with the institution of slavery in the states where it exists!&#34;

</p>
<p class="direction">
[<i>To Raymond.</i>]
</p>
<p>
What next?
</p>
<p class="speaker">
Raymond
</p>
<p>
Your plan to
<i>
colonize
</i>
the Negro race as expressed in your Proclamation of Emancipation and in the bill which you have had passed through Congress has hurt your best friends&#8212;&#8212;
</p>
<p class="speaker">
Lincoln
</p>
<p>
And why should it? My views on that subject were known to all men before you nominated me first in Chicago, four years ago. I said then that I believed there is a sharp physical difference between the white and black races, and I have always linked colonization with freedom. The Negro cannot remain in a free democracy unless we absorb him into our social and political life. Therefore, we must colonize him. We owe it to ourselves, we owe it to future generations&#8212;above all, we owe it to the Negro himself. He was brought here by cruel force. At our own expense, therefore, we should return him to the home of his fathers, and build there a free republic for his children. We should give him our language and our ideals, and we should give him millions of our money, until he can stand alone. We must face this problem squarely now.
</p>
<p class="speaker">
Raymond
</p>
<p>
Yet you compromise on other issues.
</p>
<p class="speaker">
Lincoln
</p>
<p>
Only because I must to save the Union. Trim and hedge on
<i>
this
</i>
issue, and future generations will feel their way back to it through blood and tears. I have always held that the happiness and progress of this Union of Free Democratic States will be secure only in the separation of the white and black races, and I will not eat my words!&#8212;&#8212;
</p>
<p class="direction">

&#8212;the next charge in your bill of indictment, gentlemen?

I now present the Hon. Thaddeus Stevens, leader of Congress, the representative of the radical wing of our party, who have split our organization by nominating another candidate for President&#8212;Mr. Stevens will give their views.
</p>

Stevens
</p>
<p class="direction">

<p>
Which means that you think that I am superfluous and always have been&#8212;I thank you&#8212;proceed!
</p>
<p class="speaker">
Stevens
</p>
<p>
We denounce first your policy of reconstruction in the South as weak and vacillating&#8212;a civil and military failure. As the army advances, the South should be held as conquered soil, its civilization torn up by the roots, the property of the Southern white people confiscated and given to the negroes. The ballot must be taken from the whites and given to their slaves. We demand this just vengeance and we will be content with nothing less!
</p>
<p class="speaker">
Lincoln
</p>
<p>
Stevens, I greet with shame your demands! Surely the vastness of this war, its grim battles, its heroism, its anguish, its sublime earnestness, should sink all schemes of revenge. Before the grandeur of its simple story our children will walk with uncovered heads. Conquered soil! The South has never been out of this Union. Secession was null and void from the beginning. I say to the South now, as I have always said: &#34;Come back home! You can have peace at any moment, by simply laying down your arms and submitting to the National Authority.&#34; When the South lies crushed at our feet, God's vengeance shall be enough.
</p>
<p class="speaker">
Stevens
</p>
<p>
The life of our party, sir, demands that the Negro be given the ballot and made the ruler of the South. This is not vengeance. It is justice&#8212;it is patriotism.
</p>
<p class="speaker">
Lincoln
</p>
<p>
The Nation cannot be healed until the South is healed. Let the gulf be closed in which we bury strifes and hatreds. The good sense of our people will never consent to your scheme of vengeance.
</p>
<p class="speaker">
Stevens
</p>
<p>
The people have no sense! And a new fool is born every second.
</p>
<p class="speaker">

<p class="speaker">

McClellan is even now choosing his Cabinet&#8212;&#8212;
</p>
<p class="speaker">
Lincoln

<p>
They say it is not wise to count chickens before they're hatched&#8212;we still have our chance!
</p>
<p class="speaker">
Stevens
</p>
<p>
You have no chance! You have
<i>
already
</i>
been weighed and found wanting! In the Congressional election, what happened?&#8212;your majorities were wiped out. Maine cut you down from nineteen thousand to four! The Democrats swept Ohio. Indiana deserted us. In Pennsylvania even, we lost by four thousand. New York elected Horatio Seymour against us. New Jersey turned you down. Wisconsin was a tie. In your own state of Illinois, the Democrats won by seventeen thousand&#8212;&#8212;!
</p>
<p class="speaker">
Lincoln
</p>
<p>
Even so, Stevens&#8212;the ballots in
<i>
this
</i>
election have not yet been counted! My faith in the ultimate good sense of the people is unshaken. You can fool some of the people all the time. You can fool all of the people sometimes. But you can't fool all the people all the time!
</p>
<p class="speaker">
Stevens
</p>
<p>
That's why we ask you to get off the ticket! You are to-day the most unpopular man who ever sat in the Presidential chair. For the first time in our history the effigy of a living President&#8212;your effigy&#8212;has been publicly burned in the streets of American towns and cities, amid the curses and jeers of the men who elected you! Your administration is a failure&#8212;your conduct of the war a series of blunders&#8212;&#8212;

</p>
<p class="speaker">
Stevens
</p>
<p class="direction">
[<i>Furiously.</i>]
</p>
<p>
For one thing&#8212;you have never yet chosen a successful General. The South has not changed Commanders since Jeff Davis appointed Robert E. Lee. In thirty days of the last campaign in a series of massacres, Lee has killed and wounded sixty-two thousand of our men&#8212;more than he himself commanded&#8212;and Grant has only reached the point where McClellan stood in 1862. He could have marched there by McClellan's old line without the loss of a man. Washington is piled with the wounded, the dying and the dead. Your mail is choked with letters demanding the removal of this butcher as our Commander, and you refuse&#8212;why?
</p>
<p class="speaker">
Lincoln
</p>
<p class="direction">
[<i>Smiling calmly.</i>]
</p>
<p>
Well, now that you've
<i>
really
</i>
let off steam, I think you'll feel better, Stevens&#8212;&#8212;!
</p>
<p class="speaker">
Stevens
</p>
<p>
I demand, sir, an answer to my question&#8212;why have you not removed Grant?
</p>
<p class="speaker">
Lincoln
</p>
<p class="direction">
[<i>Quickly.</i>]
</p>
<p>
Because I can't spare him! He is the one General we have developed who knows how to fight&#8212;his business is not to reach any particular spot where McClellan stood. McClellan was generally
<i>
standing
</i>
somewhere&#8212;he was a great engineer&#8212;of the stationary type&#8212;&#8212; Grant is a fighter. His business is to find and destroy Lee's army&#8212;and his sledge hammer blows are winning this war!
</p>
<p class="speaker">
Stevens
</p>
<p>
Winning&#8212;is he? And yet Lee sends a division under Jubal Early and reconquers the Valley of Virginia&#8212;invades Maryland and Pennsylvania, throws his shells into Washington and burns the home of one of your Cabinet&#8212;&#8212;
</p>
<p class="speaker">
Lincoln
</p>
<p>
And if old Jubal Early had been a little
<i>
earlier</i>, he would have burned Washington, too&#8212;but thank God, Grant got here in time&#8212;didn't he? What have you got to say to that?
</p>
<p class="speaker">
Stevens
</p>
<p>
That Lee's strategy has been superb, his moral victory complete! He holds Grant by the throat while he invades the North, and
<i>
shells
</i>
our Capitol&#8212;a feat that not one of your generals has yet done for Richmond in four years&#8212;and still you cling to Grant&#8212;&#8212;!
</p>
<p class="speaker">
Lincoln
</p>
<p class="direction">
[<i>Angrily.</i>]
</p>
<p>
Now, I'm going to talk plain English to you, Stevens. You're an Abolitionist, and you can't do Grant justice. Your crowd demanded his removal after the battle of Shiloh&#8212;and you made it so hot for me then, I had to appoint General Halleck his superior, to save him for the country. You can't forget that Grant is a Democrat, and therefore he may vote for McClellan against our party, in this election!
</p>
<p class="speaker">
Stevens
</p>
<p>
I've heard that he
<i>
is
</i>
for McClellan.
</p>
<p class="speaker">
Lincoln
</p>
<p>
Exactly! And you can't forget that his wife is a Southern woman whose dowry was in Slaves, and therefore at this moment, Grant is constructively a slaveholder, whose slaves I have not freed&#8212;&#8212;
</p>
<p class="speaker">
Stevens
</p>
<p>
I protest&#8212;&#8212;
</p>
<p class="speaker">
Lincoln
</p>
<p>
It's no use&#8212;I know the process of your mind&#8212;I can see the wheels go round inside! You tell me that the star of Grant has set in a welter of blood before Lee's army. I do not believe it. I know that miles of hospital barracks are the witnesses of our agony. I know that every city, town and village is in mourning. From these stricken homes there has arisen a storm of protest against the new leader of the army. The word butcher is bandied from lip to lip. They tell me that Grant is merely a bulldog fighter&#8212;that he can win only as long as thousands are poured into his ranks to take the place of the dead&#8212;They tell me that he has no genius, no strategy, no skill. My reply to this is simple but unanswerable. We must fight to win. Grant is the ablest general we have developed. His losses are appalling&#8212;but the struggle is on now to the bitter end! Our resources are exhaustless. The South cannot replace
<i>
her
</i>
fallen soldiers&#8212;and therefore
<i>
her
</i>
losses are fatal! If we continue to fight, five millions cannot whip twenty millions&#8212;the end is certain&#8212;and we're now locked in the last death grapple before&#8212;VICTORY!

Don't&#8212;don't&#8212;don't say such foolish things. You need a guardian. You kept three men in your Cabinet who used their position to try to climb into the Presidency over your head. And you didn't kick them out.

</p>
<p class="speaker">
Lincoln
</p>
<p class="direction">
[<i>Interrupting.</i>]
</p>
<p>
Just a moment&#8212;I have not treated you with injustice&#8212;I have treated you with more than justice. I have treated you with the generous faith and love of a father for a wayward boy&#8212;&#8212;
</p>
<p class="speaker">
McClellan
</p>
<p>
Really!
</p>
<p class="speaker">
Lincoln
</p>
<p>
I have. When I appointed you to the chief command of our Army, you were but thirty-four years old. I did it against the bitterest opposition of my party leaders. They told me you were a pro-Slavery Democrat&#8212;a political meddler, and that you were opposed to me on every issue before the people. I refused to listen. I asked but one question: Is McClellan the man to whip the new army into a mighty fighting machine, and hurl it against the Confederacy? I said to them: &#34;I don't care what his religion is, or his politics may be. The question is, not whether I shall save the Union&#8212;but that the Union shall be saved. My future and the future of my party can take care of themselves&#34;&#8212;and I appointed you.
</p>
<p class="speaker">
McClellan
</p>
<p>
And forced me to march against Richmond before I was ready!
</p>
<p class="speaker">
Lincoln
</p>
<p>
I ordered you to move, because it was necessary to forestall a great tragedy. Your army of 180,000 men had gone into winter quarters around a glittering camp over which a young Napoleon presided. Fools about you daily advised that you proclaim the end of the Republic and establish yourself as Dictator. You do not deny this&#8212;&#8212;?
</p>
<p class="speaker">
McClellan
</p>
<p>
No. The fact is well known. Besides, Stanton, your Secretary of War, was at that time my attorney, and he knew&#8212;&#8212;
</p>
<p class="speaker">
Lincoln
</p>
<p>
Exactly. I took the bull by the horns and ordered your grand army to move on Richmond. When you failed and retreated, I refused to dismiss you against the fierce protest of my Cabinet. I left you in command of half our men and appointed General Pope to lead the other half.
</p>
<p class="speaker">
McClellan
</p>
<p class="direction">
[<i>Sneeringly.</i>]
</p>
<p>
And he led them to overwhelming disaster at the second battle of Manassas&#8212;&#8212;
</p>
<p class="speaker">
Lincoln
</p>
<p class="direction">
[<i>Quickly.</i>]
</p>
<p>
For which disaster, you must share the blame. You were ordered to join Pope. You didn't move. Pope was broken by a deliberate design, that was little short of treason, sir. But instead of agreeing to the demand for your trial by court martial, I did the most unpopular act of my life. I reappointed you to the chief command of the whole army&#8212;defied public opinion, and faced a storm of abuse in my party councils.
</p>
<p class="speaker">
McClellan
</p>
<p>
And when I led that superb, reorganized army to our first victory at Antietam, you removed me from my command before I could win my campaign.
</p>
<p class="speaker">
Lincoln
</p>
<p>
I removed you from your command because, after you had cut Lee's army to pieces, and he had but 23,000 men left, and you had 75,000&#8212;three to one&#8212;you lay down on your arms and allowed Lee to escape across the river without a blow&#8212;while Jeb. Stuart with his cavalry once more insulted you by riding around your army. Come now, can't we leave to posterity to settle the merits of our controversy over the command of armies? Can't you believe me to-day, when I tell you with God as my witness, that I have never allowed a personal motive to enter into a single appointment or removal which I have made&#8212;&#8212;?
</p>
<p class="speaker">
McClellan
</p>
<p>
I cannot believe it&#8212;&#8212;
</p>
<p class="speaker">
Lincoln
</p>
<p>
In spite of the fact that when I reappointed you to the chief command of the army after the disaster to Pope,
<i>
you
</i>
thought that my messenger was an officer with a warrant for your arrest! You still say no&#8212;&#8212;?
</p>
<p class="speaker">
McClellan
</p>
<p>
I still say no&#8212;you
<i>
had
</i>
to do it&#8212;and you know that you
<i>
had
</i>
to reappoint me.
</p>
<p class="speaker">
Lincoln
</p>
<p>
Well, I'll not pretend that I didn't understand the seriousness of that hour. The Army
<i>
was
</i>
behind you, to a man! I sounded the officers, I sounded the men. They were against me and with you. If the leaders had dared risk their necks on a revolution, they might have won and set up a Dictatorship!
</p>
<p class="speaker">
McClellan
</p>
<p>
Just so!
</p>
<p class="speaker">
Lincoln
</p>
<p>
This power over men which you possess, General McClellan, is a marvelous thing. It is a dangerous force. It can be used to create a Nation, or destroy one. Because you held this power over your men, I honestly believed you were the ablest General in sight, and I called you back to your high position.

</p>
<p class="direction">
[<i>With a smile.</i>]
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p class="speaker">
Lincoln

<p>
You had to win or lose at Antietam. If you had won I was vindicated, and your success would have been mine! But when Lee's army escaped, you lost the power over the imagination of your men, the threat of a Dictatorship had passed&#8212;the supremacy of the civil government was restored, and I removed you from command&#8212;&#8212;
</p>

heart. The tears of widows and orphans&#8212;all, the blue and the gray&#8212;are mine! For we are equally responsible for this war! When I came here from the West, I found a panic-stricken North, strangling with the poison of Secession. Our fathers had only
<i>
dreamed
</i>
a Union&#8212;they never lived to see it. The North had threatened Secession for thirty years. Horace Greeley in his great paper on the day of my inauguration was telling the millions who hung on his word as the oracle from Heaven, that Secession was inevitable! &#34;Therefore let our erring sisters of the South go!&#34; was his daily cry. I could not have prevented this war, nor could Jefferson Davis. We are in the grip of mighty forces sweeping in from the centuries. We are fighting the battle of the ages&#8212;&#8212;

But our country's worth it, my boy, if we can only save it! Out of this agony will be born a united people. There has never been a democracy

</i>
because there's never been one without the shadow of a slave. We must build a real Government of the people, by the people, for the people. It's not the question merely of four million black slaves. It's a question of the life of freemen yet unborn. I hear the tread of these coming millions. Their destiny is in your hands and mine.

They say he will compromise. Now I've sent two men down there&#8212;Colonel Jacquess, a Methodist clergyman, of our hospital service, and John R. Gilmore of the

Not so well as usual&#8212;the truth is I've been wrestling all night with the problem of Jacquess and Gilmore. I've confirmed your view that they have given their real names. Gilmore
<i>
is
</i>
a reporter of the New York

Tribune
</i>
and Colonel Jacquess is a Methodist clergyman well known in the hospital service, in fact famous for his kindly treatment of Southern prisoners&#8212;&#8212;

<p class="speaker">
Benjamin
</p>
<p>
I agree with you that we could use the interview for our own purposes. But the trouble is, Mr. Davis is soft-hearted sometimes. He may refuse to take my advice. He may let these men go.
</p>
<p class="speaker">
Vaughan
</p>
<p>
You surely can depend on his allowing you to hold them in Libby Prison until after the election?
</p>
<p class="speaker">
Benjamin
</p>
<p>
I'm not sure of it. If he takes a notion to let them go&#8212;he's as stubborn as a mule.
</p>
<p class="speaker">
Vaughan
</p>
<p>
All right&#8212;Let me be present at the interview and take notes. If Mr. Davis makes an important declaration about peace and lets them go, I'll beat them to the North and give

I saw it coming and for twelve years I worked day and night to prevent it. The North was mad and blind and would not let us govern ourselves, and now it must go on until the last man of this generation falls in his tracks and their children seize their muskets and fight our battle&#8212;<i>unless you acknowledge our right to self-government</i>.

<p>
You don't seem to understand the situation! We're not exactly shut up in Richmond yet. If your papers tell the truth, it is your Capitol that is in danger, not ours. Lee's front has never yet been broken. He holds Grant, invades the North and shells Washington. Sherman, to be sure, is before Atlanta. But suppose he is? His position is a dangerous one. The further he goes from his base of supplies, the more disastrous defeat must be. And his defeat may be at hand.

Jacquess
</p>
<p>
And yet, the odds are overwhelmingly against you. How can you hope for success in the end?
</p>
<p class="speaker">
Davis
</p>
<p>
My friend, the South stands for a principle&#8212;their equal rights under the Constitution which their fathers created. This country has always been a Republic of Republics&#8212;not an Empire. We are fighting for the right of local self-government which we won from the tyrants of the old world. The states of the Union have always been sovereign. We never paused to figure on success or failure, sir. Five million Southern freemen drew their sword against twenty millions because their rights had been invaded.
</p>
<p class="speaker">
Jacquess

<p>
And yet, Mr. Davis, you know as well as I that five millions cannot hold out forever against twenty. Have we not reached the end?
</p>
<p class="speaker">
Davis
</p>
<p>
Hardly! Do you think there
<i>
are
</i>
twenty millions in the North still determined to crush us? If so, let me tell you that I am better informed on the present situation inside your lines than you are. The North at this moment is hopelessly divided, sir&#8212;&#8212;

They are our stark fighters&#8212;men who individually or in the mass can be depended on for any feat of arms in the power of mortals to accomplish. I know them from experience. They will blanch at nothing&#8212;yet they must have food.
</p>
<p class="speaker">
Davis
</p>
<p>
You shall have it. But after one year&#8212;then what?
</p>
<p class="speaker">
Lee
</p>
<p>
It's solely a question of man power, sir. I
<i>
must
</i>
have more men.
</p>
<p class="speaker">
Davis
</p>
<p>
And you suggest?
</p>
<p class="speaker">
Lee
</p>
<p>
That you immediately begin to arm and drill 500,000 negroes for my command.
</p>
<p class="speaker">
Davis
</p>
<p>
And you think they would make good soldiers?
</p>
<p class="speaker">
Lee
</p>
<p>
Led by their old masters&#8212;they'll fight&#8212;to a man.
</p>
<p class="speaker">
Davis
</p>
<p>
It would be necessary to give each black volunteer his freedom?
</p>
<p class="speaker">
Lee
</p>
<p>
Of course. I, as you know, freed my own slaves before entering the service of the South. It is one of the ironies of Fate that I am supposed to be fighting for slavery&#8212;I who refuse to own a slave and my opponent General Grant is through his wife's estate a slaveholder. Slavery is doomed, sir. It can never survive this tragedy. The Legislature of Virginia came within one vote of freeing her slaves, years ago.
</p>
<p class="speaker">
Davis
</p>
<p>
I know. But the great Gulf States and South Carolina with their majority of Negro population will never agree to the arming of half a million slaves.
</p>
<p class="speaker">
Lee
</p>
<p>
And you will allow Mississippi, Louisiana, and South Carolina to defeat a plan necessary to save the life of the Confederacy?
</p>
<p class="speaker">
Davis
</p>
<p>
The States are sovereign, General Lee&#8212;for this principle we are fighting.
</p>
<p class="speaker">
Lee
</p>
<p>
Then I think it may be time to ask ourselves, heart to heart, the question whether the Confederacy, as organized, does not carry within its own body the seeds of death? The rights of a state must somewhere yield to the supreme power of a nation. The Negro will make a brave soldier, and he can save the South. Will you use him?
</p>
<p class="speaker">
Davis
</p>
<p>
I'll consider your suggestion, General, but I can't see it&#8212;I can't see it now. I won't detain you longer.

This old farmer raised the biggest hog ever seen in the county. He was so fat the news of his size spread over the country and people came from far and near to see this wonder in pork. A stranger came up one day and asked the farmer to see him. The old man said: &#34;Wal I've got sech a animal an' he's the biggest one I ever seed. I'll say that. But so many folks are comin' here pesterin' me to look at him, I've decided to charge a shillin' a look.&#34; The stranger put his hand in his pocket, pulled out the money, paid the shilling, stared at the old man, turned and walked away. The farmer called after him&#8212;&#34;Hi&#8212;there&#8212;ain't yer goin' ter see the hog?&#34; &#34;No&#34;&#8212;the fellow answered&#8212;&#34;I've seen you! I've got my money's worth.&#34;

Yet, if God wills that it continue until all the wealth piled by the bondman's two hundred and fifty years of unrequited toil shall be sunk, and until every drop of blood drawn with the lash shall be paid by another drawn with the sword, as was said three thousand years ago, so still it must be said, &#34;The judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether.&#34;
